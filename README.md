# Shell Script Tutorial Repository

## Overview
Welcome to the Shell Script Tutorial Store! This repository is where I study Unix/Linux shell scripts and store the source code I wrote. Shell scripts are powerful tools for automating tasks on Unix-like operating systems.

## What is Shell Scripting?
Shell scripting is a method to automate tasks directly on a Unix/Linux command line. A shell script is a script written for the shell, or command line interpreter, of an operating system. It is often used for system administration, running applications, and processing text.
``` bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello, World."
```

  
## Usage

To run a script:
```bash
# 1
sh path/to/your-script.sh

# 2
chmod +x path/to/your-script.sh
.path/to/your-script.sh
```

## Features of Shell Scripting
- Automation: Automate repetitive tasks efficiently.
- System Administration: Manage system operations, user accounts, and software updates.
- Process Control: Manage and control the execution of other programs.
- Text Processing: Manipulate text files easily with tools like sed, awk, grep.
